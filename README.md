I recommend creating a virtual environment for django and postgres

## Virtual environment (Windows)
Create virtual environment (be sure to create outside of the local repository):
```
py -m venv #name-of-environment
```

To activate enviroment:
```
#name-of-environment/Scripts/activate
```
To deactivate enviroment:
```
deactivate
```

## To initialize django aplication (Windows):
```
cd software-architecture/goodreads
py manage.py runserver
```
## Local URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Progress:
- [ ] add postgresql
